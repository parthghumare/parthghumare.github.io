## Work Experience
**Financial Data Analyst @ Quantiphi Analytics (_September 2021 - July 2022_)**
- Conducted data cleaning and preparation of insurance claim data using a Python workflow that combined data from multiple sources, and developed 15+ comprehensive Tableau dashboards.
- Implemented a new risk monitoring framework that increased the frequency and depth of reviews, reducing unidentified credit exposures by 30% and enhancing the bank's risk management capabilities.
- Designed and implemented data workflows, automating financial data processing for over 5M+ rows using AWS Glue and S3, reducing monthly data preparation hours from 80 to 40.
- Revised credit policies, resulting in a 20% decrease in overdue loans and maintained a more robust credit portfolio aligned with the bank's risk appetite.
- Translated business questions into SQL queries and analyzed quarterly sales patterns on their web platform to help the marketing strategy team, resulting in a 35% increase in sales.
- Automated major manual MS Excel reports to Power BI Dashboards, increasing reporting efficiency by 70%.

**Business Intelligence Analyst Intern @ The Maverics Technologies (_May 2020 - September 2021_)**
- Spearheaded the development and maintenance of 10+ analytical dashboards in Power BI, for enterprise level sales and operations data, driving a 30% boost in delivery efficiency.
- Enabled reporting of real-time insights by integrating multiple data sources and gathering retail client requirements for YOY trends, sales, and attrition dashboards.
- Translated business questions into SQL queries analyzing quarterly sales patterns on web platform to help the marketing strategy team, resulting in a 35% increase in sales.
- Trained two interns on Power BI to develop and deliver reports to senior management.

**Research Assistant @ The University of Texas at Dallas (_May 2023 - Present_)**
- Research on neural network model performance based on architecture and depth separation variance.
- Worked on optimizing boosting and bagging algorithms using feature engineering and SHAP analysis.
- Project focusing on predicting customer response rates based on the channel of contact, aiding in the development of marketing strategies.

### Neural Network Architecture Performance Comparison
The University of Texas at Dallas – [Github](https://github.com/parthghumare/Deep-Narrow-versus-Shallow-Wide-Neural-Network-Model-Performance)
- A study on why neural networks keep getting deeper but not wider for various industry applications.
- The goal of this project is to compare the performance of deep and narrow versus shallow and wide neural networks on specific tasks to determine which architecture offers the best trade- off between accuracy, training time, and computational efficiency.
